# Brainwrite with LLM experts ðŸ§ 

**Brainwrite** is a creative technique used to generate ideas within a group setting. 

**Process:**
1. **Define the Problem:** Start by clearly stating the problem or topic that needs to be addressed.
2. **Individual Writing:** Each participant writes down their ideas individually, often on a sheet of paper or a digital platform.
3. **Passing Ideas:** After a set time, participants pass their ideas to the next person, who then adds to or builds upon them.
4. **Rounds of Writing:** This process is repeated for several rounds to ensure that all ideas are shared and developed.
5. **Review and Discussion:** Once all ideas have been collected, the group reviews them and discusses the most promising ones.
